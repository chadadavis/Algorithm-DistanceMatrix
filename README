This is a small helper package for L<Algorithm::Cluster>. That module provides 
many facilities for clustering data. It also provides a C<distancematrix> function,
but assumes tabular data, which is the standard for gene expression data. 

If your data is tabular, you should first have a look at C<distancematrix> in
L<Algorithm::Cluster>

Otherwise, this package provides a simple distance matrix, given an arbitrary 
distance function. It does not assume anything about your data. You simply 
provide a callback function for measuring the distance between any two objects.
It produces a lower diagonal (by default) distance matrix that is fit to be used
by the clustering algorithms of L<Algorithm::Cluster>.
